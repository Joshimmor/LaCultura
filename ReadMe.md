## Fitness lifestyle brand with an intergrated E-commerce site
This is a bootstrap based site with  alot of custom Css.
This site also uses libraries such a ScrollMagic and
GSAP for the animations.

## Shopify
The E-commerce platform used is Shopify, the reason I 
decided to use this was to relieve myself from the responsibility
of updating the site unless it is completely necessary

## Wordpress Blog found at Lacultura.training/blog
Like the E-Commerce side the Wordpress backend was added so that 
site owner can update his own site 

## To be added
Adding a web-based application for calculating Macro nutrients for
users
